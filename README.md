# Install

You'll need a version of **Python 3** installed.

1. Create a virtual environment for this application.
I used the `virtualenv` tool.
	```
	pip install virtualenv
	python -m virtualenv EnvironmentName
	```

2. Clone the repo at `master` into the environment you just created.

3. Install necessary packages.
	- `pip install Django==3.1.7`
